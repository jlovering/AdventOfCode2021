# AdventOfCode2021

This is a repo of my days for Advent Of Code 2021 (adventofcode.com). I'm no competitive programmer, but as a challenge this year we decided to do the contest in a new to us language. For me that is go.
This code probably doesn't look very goish to experience go programers... likely that is since I'm translating C, C++, Python (and the list goes on) into go as I solve, so some things are just not very idomatic in go.
